# images_api
This is a simple code that can be used to download a desired number of images of a query(eg: fruits) into a folder which will automatically be created in your D directory... under TrainingImages.

This file path can be changed as per your requirement.

Please make sure you have a Bing Image Search API key with you before code execution. You can get it here --> https://rapidapi.com/microsoft-azure-org-microsoft-cognitive-services/api/bing-image-search1

Replace none in the api_key variable with your API key.
